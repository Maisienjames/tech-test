# React Tech Test

This was a mock tech test for a React Developer role. The brief was to build a basic React web application that allows users to search for images by keywords related to space, which would be pulled from NASA's image library using a specified endpoint (https://images-api.nasa.gov/search ​Params: ​​q). The app makes use of Axios and PropTypes to ensure the right data is received, and I used Jest and React Testing Library to build my tests.

## Screenshots

## How to run the app on your machine:

First, clone the repo using

### `$git clone git@github.com:Maisienjames/tech-test.git`

then use

### `$npm install`

to install the necessary dependencies,\

### `$npm start`

to run the app in development mode, and\

### `$npm test`

to test the app.\

## If I'd had more time I would have:

- Made the app more responsive to different devices
- Added more complex search features
- Added more styling and some basic animation
- Added a feature to enable the user to enlarge each image when clicked
